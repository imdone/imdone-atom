imdone-atom
----
I have decided to retire as the imdone-atom maintainer.  Instead, I'm putting all my energy into **[imdone desktop](https://imdone.io/docs)**, an electron based desktop app that works with any text editor.  If you would like to take over maintenance of imdone-atom, please [contact me](email:jesse@imdone.io).

The latest release source code is available in the **[archive](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-atom/tree/archive)** branch.

Sincerely,

Jesse Piascik
